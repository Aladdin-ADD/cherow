## Cherow unit tests

The majority of Cherow internal tests are taken from the `Test262 test suite` or `Test262-parser-tests` suite. There have been 
encountered a strange behavior with some of this tests - they doesn't fail or pass according to the specs.

To stil be able to run this tests, they can  be found in the miscellaneous/failures.ts file where they do fail as they should.
